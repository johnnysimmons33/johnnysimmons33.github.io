        <h4>My Story</h4>
        <p>I was born in Jacksonville, FL at Memorial Hospital around 8 pm the night of May 4, 1988 to a Marcia Elizabeth Simmons and her husband, John Wesley Simmons, Jr. They named me for my father, making me a tres. In 2018, March to be more specific, I learned what the name Trey/Tre/Tres stood for, and I decided I was not a Trey/Tre/Tres in style, though certainly in spirit and in actuality I was. Thus, my name remains rooted in my father's lineage, not in the structure of the history of my name.
